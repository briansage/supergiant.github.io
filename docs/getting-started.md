# Getting Started

Getting going with Supergiant is a quick, simple process - and most everything you need to do can be done through the [dashboard][dashboard].

To get you familiarized with the process we're going to go through a demonstration of how to stand up a simple Node app, with the following parts:

* A MongoDB database
* A lightweight web front-end
* A separate back-end server
* A redis work queue
* A separate admin server, with a custom security layer

Sounds complicated, right?  Usually, yes - but not with Supergiant.  We'll provide some simple code to load up the given resources, and run you through the whole process here.

After going through this guide, you will know:

* [How to create and manage your own app][app-design]
* [How to secure or expose specific parts of your app][app-security]
* [How to distribute and duplicate parts of your app][app-distribution]
* [How to make different stages (production, test) versions of your app][app-stages]
