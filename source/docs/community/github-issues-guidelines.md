# GitHub Issues Guidelines

If you see something that needs to be improved, please open a GitHub Issue on the library's issues page.


## When You Find a Problem

 Always perform a quick search though Supergiant issues to see whether someone else has found the same problem and has already created one. Supergiant is made of a few major components, so it's good to know where to look

* Search [Supergiant Issues][SG Issues] for problems affecting the API
* Search [Supergiant CLI Issues][SG CLI Issues] for problems affecting the Command Line Interface
* Search [Supergiant Dashboard Issues][SG UI Issues] for problems affecting the web browser-accessible Dashboard
* Search [Supergiant Installer Issues][SG Installer Issues] for problems encountered while running the command line Installer
* Search [Supergiant Documentation Issues][SG Docs Issues] for problems encountered while running the command line Installer

If you find someone else talking about the problem, engage! Give the conversation a thumbs-up, and if there are any details missing, please add them. If nobody else is talking about the problem, congratulations! You're in undiscovered territory, and it time to create a new issue for the community.


## How to Create a New Issue

* **Record it.** Then attach a quick GIF of the recording to your Issue. You don't have to, but in most cases it really helps if we can see  how you arrived at the bug event.

* **Explain it.** Remember that we're human, we take pride in our work, we want to fix our things when they go wrong. Write a good description that helps us out by making sure it contains: 1. the bugged behavior, and 2. the expected behavior. [Issue #94][GitHub Issue Example] is a pretty good example of how to do this.

The core team will engage in the discussion and will prioritize what we can do to fix the problem.
