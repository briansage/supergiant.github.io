# GitHub Issues

If you see something that needs to be improved, please open a GitHub Issue on the library's issues page.

## Issue Creation Guidelines

*If it affects the dashboard, record it.* Then attach a quick GIF of the recording to your Issue. You don't have to, but in most cases it really helps if we can see visually how you arrived at the bug event.

Remember that we're human, we take pride in our work, we want to fix our things when they go wrong. Write a good description that helps us out by making sure it contains: 1) the bugged behavior, 2) the expected behavior. [Issue #94](https://github.com/supergiant/supergiant-dashboard/issues/94) is a pretty good example of how to do this.

The core team will engage in the discussion and will prioritize what we can do to fix the problem.
