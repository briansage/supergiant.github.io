# Start Here

Welcome to Supergiant 101.

Our goal is to make Supergiant as easy as possible to use, from the terminal to the GUI and all points in between. Concepts and terminology are all the same, so what you learn to do with your mouse, you can take to the command line when ever you want to (not that you have to).
