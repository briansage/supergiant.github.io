## Contributor License Agreements

We, the Supergiant team, believe strongly that we can learn more from each other by collaborating and sharing our best ideas. We invite you to share your best ideas along with us.

Before we can accept work into a Supergiant project, we need to make sure it's ready for Supergiant's open-source license. The Contributor License Agreement form we ask all our contributors to sign is the same agreement in place for many open-source projects. It protects the project from any form of greedy control, and it ensures contributions will continue to remain open-source forever.
